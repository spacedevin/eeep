## Implementation Strategy
1. Use HyperFormula for:
   - Array formulas
   - Dynamic arrays
   - Core calculation engine
   - Dependency tracking

2. Use Formula.js for:
   - Standard functions
   - Financial calculations
   - Statistical functions
   - Common operations

3. Custom Implementation for:
   - Complex financial functions
   - Advanced statistical functions
   - Matrix operations
   - Engineering functions

## Next Steps
1. Implement advanced financial functions
2. Add statistical distributions
3. Create matrix operations
4. Add engineering functions
5. Complete test coverage
6. Update documentation

## Dependencies
- HyperFormula
- Formula.js
- Decimal.js (for precision)
- Date-fns (for date operations)

## Testing Requirements
1. Unit Tests
