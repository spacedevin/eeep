# Matrix Functions Implementation

## Basic Functions (COMPLETED âœ“)
- [x] MDETERM - Matrix determinant
- [x] MINVERSE - Matrix inverse
- [x] MMULT - Matrix multiplication
- [x] TRANSPOSE - Matrix transpose

## Advanced Functions (PENDING)
- [ ] MUNIT - Identity matrix
- [ ] EIGENVALS - Eigenvalues
- [ ] EIGENVECS - Eigenvectors
- [ ] RANK - Matrix rank
- [ ] TRACE - Matrix trace
- [ ] SOLVE - Linear equations

## Blockers
1. Performance
   - Large matrix operations
   - Memory management
   - Calculation speed
   - Cache optimization

2. Numerical Stability
   - Precision requirements
   - Error propagation
   - Condition numbers
   - Validation methods

3. Implementation
   - Complex algorithms
   - Memory constraints
   - Error handling
   - Testing needs

## Status: IN PROGRESS
Basic matrix functions are complete using custom implementation. Focus is now on:
1. Implementing advanced functions
2. Optimizing performance
3. Adding numerical stability
4. Creating test suite
5. Documenting limitations
